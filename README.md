# DiceWare - Create your passphrase as easily as throwing a set of dice!
  
Usage: Click on "Shuffle All" to shuffle all the dices. You can also shuffle only one set of dice by clicking on it.  
Moving your mouse during the shuffling will increase the randomness of the dices.  
This is a proof of concept. Even though the passphrases are generated by your computer and never sent online, you should NOT use this website to generate your actual passwords.  

According to WikiPedia:  
Diceware is a method for creating passphrases, passwords, and other cryptographic variables using an ordinary die from a pair of dice as a hardware random number generator. For each word in the passphrase, five rolls of the dice are required. The numbers from 1 to 6 that come up in the rolls are assembled as a five-digit number, e.g. 43146. That number is then used to look up a word in a word list. In the English list 43146 corresponds to "munch".
